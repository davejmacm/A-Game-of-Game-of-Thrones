# A-Game-of-Game-of-Thrones
CodeClan project

A Game of Game of Thrones is a fantasy application for Game of Thrones. 
The application will host/run a fantasy game of Game of Thrones [based on fantasy football; players add characters to their team and gain points for actions on screen].

## Resources
The project follows an MVC model to produce the backend, webserver and frontend. It utilises Ruby, Sinatra and PSQL.

The development environment was achieved on Mac from homebrew:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
From a terminal prompt.
